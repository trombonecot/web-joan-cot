Hi,

I'm Joan, I'm 34 years old and I do music. I primarily work in performance arts, producing music for circus shows, theatre and dance. I have collaborated with Animal Religion, Los Galindos, Circ Vermut, Cia. Mov-i-ments and Cia. Pscioproject, and I have performed in Temporada Alta festival, Mercat de les Flors, TNT and C!CAF, amongst others.

At this moment I'm producing two shows with Animal Religion, one for children aged 2 to 5 called ...and the ideas soar, and another one to be premiered in April 2020 in the National Catalan Theatre called Ahir (Yesterday). At the same time I collaborate with Julia Mariscal in the performance Ocells-textos-onades (Birds-texts-waves) that will premier in January 2020 in Barcelona's Teatre Lliure.

On top of this I work in my own project blending vibraphone and electronics, I produce music with the european electronic music collective Worran, I play with the free improvisation duet Iklo and I play in the brass band Microbrass.

Listen and feel free to contact if you feel like it.
