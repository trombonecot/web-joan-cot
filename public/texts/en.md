**Joan Cot Ros**

Hi!

I'm Joan and I'm a musical composer, producer and conductor interested in contemporary art and interdisciplinarity. I got my degree on Music Composition from University College Falmouth (incorporating Dartington College of Arts) in UK, where I studied contemporary composition and free improvisation. I have written scores for contemporary ensembles, jazz, music for circus, dance, theatre, literature, poetry, short and feature films and advertisments. I mainly work in performing arts and the music that interests me is electronic experimental. 

I'm part of the circus company Animal Religion. I have colaborated with artists like Joan Català, Los Galindos, SLMFV, Lucas Condró, Irene Vicente Salas, Roi Borrallas, Carlota Grau, Milagros Garcia, Aurora Bauzà i Pere Jou, Martí Soler, Circ Vermut and Laura Alcalà, amongst others. I've performed in theatres and festivals like TNC, Mercat de les Flors, Teatre Lliure, Temporada Alta, Festival Grec, Festival elPetit, Festival TNT, Teatros del Canal, Festival Mirada (Brazil), Edinburgh Children's Festival, Berlin Circus Festival or C!CAF (Denmark).
