**Joan Cot Ros**

Hi,

I'm Joan and I'm a musical composer and sound artist interested in contemporary art and interdisciplinarity. I got my degree on Music Composition from University College Falmouth (incorporating Dartington College of Arts) in UK around 2012. Since then I developed multiple projects ranging from circus, dance and theatre, to sound installations and music for audiovisuals. My artistic research deals with the relation between control and no-control of the elements used in the compositions and the relations they establish.

I'm part of the circus company Animal Religion. I have colaborated with artists like Joan Català, Cristina Maldonado, Irene Vicente Salas, Roi Borrallas, Los Galindos, SLMFV, Lucas Condró, Carlota Grau, Milagros Garcia, Aurora Bauzà i Pere Jou, Martí Soler, Circ Vermut and Laura Alcalà, amongst others. I've performed in theatres and festivals like TNC, Mercat de les Flors, Teatre Lliure, Temporada Alta, Festival Grec, Festival elPetit, Festival TNT, Teatros del Canal, Festival Mirada (Brazil), Festival Oerol, Edinburgh Children's Festival, Berlin Circus Festival or C!CAF (Denmark).
